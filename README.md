## Problem 1 (Array sum)
Identify whether there exists a pair of numbers in an array such that
their sum is equal to **N**.

Input:
The first line contains one integer *N*, which is the sum we are trying to find.
The second line contains one integer *M*, which is the length of the array.
This is followed by M lines each containing one element of the array.

Output:
Output 1 if there exists a pair of numbers in the array such that their
sum equals N. If such a pair does not exist, output 0.

Sample Input:
```
66
